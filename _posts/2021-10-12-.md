title: Holographic approach to thermalization in general anisotropic theories
description: "We employ the holographic approach to study the thermalization in the quenched strongly-coupled field theories with very general anisotropic scalings including Lifshitz and hyperscaling violating fixed points. The holographic dual is a Vaidya-like time-dependent geometry where the asymptotic metric has general anisotropic scaling isometries. We find the Ryu-Takanayagi extremal surface and use it to calculate the time-dependent entanglement entropy between a strip region with width 2R and its outside region. In the special case with an isotropic metric, we also explore the entanglement entropy for a spherical region of radius R. The growth of the entanglement entropy characterizes the thermalization rate after a quench. We study the thermalization process in the early times and late times in both large R and small R limits. The allowed scaling parameter regions are constrained by the null energy conditions as well as the condition for the existence of the Ryu-Takanayagi extremal surfaces. This generalizes the previous works on this subject. All obtained results can be compared with experiments and other methods of probing thermalization."

## ***Introduction***

The holographic duality provides a unique method to investigate the dynamics of strongly coupled field theories, which links geometrical quantities to quantum observables. The
uses of this interplay to study thermal phases of strongly coupled field theories by their holographically dual AdS black hole/brane geometries have attracted lots of attention since it was first porposed. It was then suggested that the small perturbations of the AdS metric are dual to the hydrodynamics or linear response theories of the boundary CFTs. Also, by probed strings in the AdS background, the diffusion behavior of Brownian particles in the boundary fields can be derived. In particular, the time
evolution of entanglement entropy between Brownian particles and boundary fields had been studied by means of the probed string method.
