# <font color=black>Experience</font>

(Jul 2021 - Present)<br> 
#### R&D Engineer
<ol>
<li>Design engineer for high power magnetics:</li> 
  
- Designing the high power magnetics for automotive applications, such as electrical reactor, transformer, PFC choke, output choke (including coupled inductors) for EV/HEV/FCEV. 
- I mainly focus on on board charger (OBC) and DCDC converters in powertrain, such as 11kW/22kW CLLLC or DAB (in three/two phases) OBC Xfmr, and phase-shifted full bridge(PSFB) DC/DC Xfmr.
- Recently, I have involved in numerous projects that are related to OBC+DCDC combined Xfmr, a state-of-the-art concept where we integrate OBC Xfmr and DCDC Xfmr into a single Xfmr. This high-end Xfmr might become a cost-effective solution in the future.

<li>Developing automated design by Python:</li> 

- I am familiar with Python and proficient in constructing theoretical models and solving mathematical problems.
- For Xfmr design, it involves a variety of architectures and numerous design parameters (typically they have $\sim 100000$ possible solutions for one customer's requirement).
- We develop the algorithm with GUI so that engineers can easily choose the optimized cost effective solution from those possible solutions.

<li>Field application engineer (FAE):</li> 

- erving as a communication bridge between our engineering team and global customers.
- Supporting the technical discussion with global customers.
- Organizing team members to work on projects.  

<li>Advanced research:</li> 

- Studying analytic calculations, simulation of electromagnetic theory, circuit topology as well as new design platform.
